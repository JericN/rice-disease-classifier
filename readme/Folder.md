# Research Project Directory Overview

This directory contains all relevant materials for the submission of the thesis/research project, organized into the following folders. These materials include source code, datasets, presentations, documentation, and LaTeX source files. Each subfolder is described below.


## Folder Structure and Descriptions

### 📁 `source code`
Contains the complete pipeline used in the project — from dataset preparation and augmentation to model fine-tuning, evaluation, and result processing. This includes all Jupyter notebooks and scripts used to run experiments on Vision Transformer, CNN, and hybrid models.  

**Includes:**
- Dataset splitting, augmentation, upload/download scripts
- Partial and full fine-tuning pipelines
- Evaluation scripts (accuracy, inference speed, ensemble)
- Result processing and visualization tools

---

### 📁 `presentations`
Includes the slide decks and presentation materials used during the course of the project. These may include proposal presentations, final defense slides, and demo day decks.

**Includes:**
- PowerPoint and PDF versions of research and demo presentations

---

### 📁 `documents (raw)`
Contains the raw LaTeX source files for the manuscript, conference paper, and other technical documents. This folder includes `.tex` files, figures, and other necessary assets to allow complete reconstruction of the documents.

**Includes:**
- Separate subfolders for each document type (e.g., research paper, conference paper, user manual)
- LaTeX source files, bibliography files, images, and build assets

---

### 📁 `documents`
Contains the compiled outputs of the documents generated throughout the project. These are the finalized versions of reports, papers, and proposals.

**Includes:**
- Final PDF versions of:
  - Manuscript
  - Conference paper
  - Project proposal
  - User’s manual

---

### 📁 `datasets`
Contains the image datasets used for model training, validation, and testing. This ensures that all experiments are reproducible using the provided source code and data.

**Includes:**
- Raw and preprocessed image datasets
- Folder structures used during model training

---

### Additional Notes

- All relevant papers, code, and data needed to reproduce results are included in this directory.
- Notebooks automatically install required packages when run.
- All software and document outputs are organized and named consistently to facilitate navigation and reproduction of the project.
