# üçÉ Rice Leaf Disease Dataset

This folder contains the image dataset used for training and evaluating models in the rice leaf disease classification project.


## Dataset Overview

- The dataset consists of rice leaf images labeled across 8 disease categories plus healthy leaves.
- Images were captured under natural field conditions.
- The dataset has been preprocessed, split into training, validation, and test sets, and augmented to improve model generalization.


## Accessing the Dataset

You can access the dataset locally in this folder or directly from our Hugging Face repository:
