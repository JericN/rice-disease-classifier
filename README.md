# Rice Disease Detection using Machine Vision and Transformer Models

This project focuses on detecting rice diseases using machine vision techniques and transformer models, leveraging the Hugging Face library.

## Environment Setup

To set up the environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

activate the virtual environment:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```
```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

## Project Structure

- `requirements.txt` : Contains the dependencies for the project.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up the virtual environment and install dependencies.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook to start experimenting with the models.

## Dependencies

Install the dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
